<h2 class="head"><center>Who can attend and when?</h2></center>
<p>Well, anyone can attend. Wether your a baby, kid, adult, or senior! Everyone will have fun doing something.
The park is open from May 21 to Setember 5. It's open near the summer and not fall-spring because it will be cold outside 
at those times and everyone in the water will be freezing. The opening time is at 10:00 AM and it closes at 5:00 pm to 8:00 pm.
 It is different every day.</p>
 
 <h3 class="head"><center>What if i'm handicapped?</h3></center>
<p>Well if you are handicapped, it is suggested you call the service associate ahead of time so they can prepare for your visit to the park. There are pools in the park so if your handicapped then you can go in the water with your kids or your grand children. It is recommended you shouldn't go on thrill rides if you have health problems. 
You could also rest in a rented cabana and take a nice nap in the summer breeze.

<p><strong class="head"><center>Where did you get your information?</center></strong></p>

<p>I got my information at the Water Country USA webpage. I looked around the page and these are the specific 
pages I got the information so it isn't copyright or plagerism since i'm promoting their park and helping them get customers. Well I found them down below... But the owner of the website is in fact me! The amazing Tony no last name! 
My favorite place is the wave pool down below. The people had to be blurred out because they never gave me permission to put them on this website!<br><center> <img src="images/pool.jpg" height="350" width="450"></center>

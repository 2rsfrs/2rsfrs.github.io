<h2 class="heading" id="popeyes">History of Popeyes and their FOODS!</h2>
<p>In the beginning, which is 1972, a genius named, <strong>Alvin C. Copeland</strong>, makes a resturaunt called "Chicken on the run," in "New Orleans suburb of Arabi."
The place sold southern fried chicken! However, the place wasn't a great hit and not many people went to it for food. After a few months, Alvin had 
another <strong>GREAT</strong> idea and <strong>remakes</strong> the restaurant and names the new restaurant, "Popeyes". He sold spicy chicken, New Orleans style. 
In 1983 someone had another <strong>BRILLIANT</strong> idea. They now had buttermilk in their kitchen and they used it to make biscuits. By 1999, Popeyes 
has <strong>1000 not 100, not 200 1000! resturaunts!</strong> In 2002, Popeyes is finally 30 years old! In 2009, Popeyes adds another item to eat. It is the Butterfly 
shrimp tackle box! In 2010, Popeyes adds more food. Now they made Wicked Chicken! It was awarded <strong>BEST LIMITED TIME OFFER.</strong>(all the images of the food will be shown below.) 
When 2011 comes by, popeyes has 2000 resturaunts this time. In the course of 12 YEARS they had 1,000 MORE resturaunts than before! 1 year later, after all this, popeyes now is 40 years old! 
Congratulations Popeyes, Congratulations.

<h3 class="heading" id="rice">Rice~~!</h3>
<p>In China, long ago, like 8,200-13,500 years ago, Shennong, an emporor of China, domesticated rice in the Pearl River but later it was suggested that rice had been domesticated 
in the Yangtze River. (this is a Chinese Legend by the way.) From East Asia, rice spread to the Southeast and the South of Asia. From there it spread to Europe from Western Asia. 
How to make rice is with uncooked rice, a rice cooker, and water. As seen in this video...<br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TUF1Onz9RKQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>

<p>One day in China, a person had an idea... to fry the rice with vegtables, eggs, and meats! Thus began FRIED RICE! People in China made fried rice for banquets and in America, it is sold as
fast food. If you want to make it you need to get a pan and some ingredients. Please Note:Fish sauce and sugar are not required, you can add it if you want. You can also watch the video which teaches you what to do with these ingredients below.
You need,
<ul>
<li class="list">cold rice</li>
<li class="list">Egg</li>
<li class="list">Beef or your choice of meat</li>

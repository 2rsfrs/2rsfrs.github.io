<div id="border"><h1>Siberian Huskies!</h1>

<p>Siberian Huskies are dogs that were bred by the Chukchi tribe in the past. Siberian Huskies have 2 coats/layers so they won't be cold if they<br>
live in the cold. They have eye that look like almonds. They are like wolves because they howl. They are intelligent and can jump really high!<br>
If you want to adopt a siberian husky, you will need a tall fence so they can't jump over it to escape to chase a cat.</p>

<p>In the first video...In the beginning, the video is about how Siberian Huskies rescued people that were crippled. They ran through a blizzard to send a cure.<br>
They come from Siberia (wow bet you didn't expect that). It also explains how they have 2 layers which help them survive to up to -15 degrees.
They are very smart and how if you own one, you need to clean their fur once a week. They also have hip and eye issues, and perfers to live in the cold.</p>
